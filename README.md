HR Analytics Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition data to uncover key factors driving employee turnover. The insights derived from the analysis are visualized using a Power BI dashboard, providing actionable intelligence for HR teams.

Objectives
Identify the primary factors influencing employee attrition.
Develop a predictive model to forecast attrition risks.
Visualize trends and insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
Tools & Technologies
Jupyter Notebook: Used for data cleaning, analysis, and model development.
Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization in Jupyter Notebook.
Scikit-learn: For building predictive models.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the datasets used for analysis.
notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks with data cleaning, analysis, and modeling.
dashboard/: Power BI dashboard file.
README.md: Project overview and instructions.
Data
The dataset used in this project includes employee information such as demographics, job role, salary, job satisfaction, and more. The data is analyzed to understand the relationship between these factors and employee attrition.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering trends, correlations, and insights.
Attrition Prediction: Building and evaluating models to predict employee attrition.
Dashboard Visualization: An interactive Power BI dashboard for easy data interpretation.
Results
Identified key drivers of attrition, including job satisfaction, work-life balance, and compensation.
Created a predictive model with X% accuracy for forecasting employee attrition.
Developed a dashboard to visualize attrition trends and high-risk groups.
